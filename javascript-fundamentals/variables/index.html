<h1>Variables</h1>

We can declare variables to store data by using the var, let, or const keywords. <br>
<br>
<code>let</code> – is a modern variable declaration.<br>
<code>var</code> – is an old-school variable declaration. Normally we don’t use it at all, but we’ll cover subtle differences from let in the chapter The old "var", just in case you need them.<br>
<code>const</code> – is like let, but the value of the variable can’t be changed.<br>
<br>
Variables should be named in a way that allows us to easily understand what’s inside them.

<h1>Tasks</h1>
<hr>
<h2>Task 1</h2>
<h3>Working with variables</h3>
<h5>importance: 2</h5>
<p>
    Declare two variables: admin and name.
    Assign the value "John" to name.
    Copy the value from name to admin.
    Show the value of admin using alert (must output “John”).
</p>
<p>
    In the code below, each line corresponds to the item in the task list.<br>
    <code>
        let admin;<br>
        let name;<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        name = "John";<br>
        admin = name;<br>
        console.log(admin);//Prints "John"
    </code>
</p>

<h2>Task 2</h2>
<h3>Giving the right name</h3>
<h5>importance: 3</h5>
<p>
    Create a variable with the name of our planet. How would you name such a variable?<br>
    Create a variable to store the name of a current visitor to a website. How would you name that variable?
    <br><br>
    <code>
        let ourPlanet = "Earth";
    </code>
    <br><br>
    Note, we could use a shorter name planet, but it might be not obvious what planet it refers to.<br>
    It’s nice to be more verbose. At least until the variable isNotTooLong.<br><br>
    <code>
        let currentUserName = "John";
    </code>
</p>

<h2>Task 3</h2>
<h3>Uppercase const?</h3>
<h5>importance: 4</h5>

<p>
    Examine the following code:<br><br>
    <code>
        const birthday = '18.04.1982';<br>
        const age = someCode(birthday);<br>
    </code><br>
    Here we have a constant birthday date and the age is calculated from birthday with the help of some code<br>
    (it is not provided for shortness, and because details don’t matter here).<br>

    Would it be right to use upper case for birthday? For age? Or even for both?<br><br>
    <code>
        const BIRTHDAY = '18.04.1982'; // make uppercase? <br>
        const AGE = someCode(BIRTHDAY); // make uppercase?<br>
    </code><br>
</p>
<h3>Solution</h3>
<p> We generally use upper case for constants that are “hard-coded”. Or, in other words, when the value is known prior to execution<br>
    and directly written into the code.</p>

<p>In this code, birthday is exactly like that. So we could use the upper case for it.</p>

<p>In contrast, age is evaluated in run-time. Today we have one age, a year after we’ll have another one. It is constant in a sense that it does not change through the code execution. But it is a bit “less of a constant” than birthday: it is calculated, so we should keep the lower case for it.</p>
